This content is for my domain https://firebog.net as well as my Big Blocklist Collection.

## Why use this over other sources?
Due to my DNS sink-holing experience (which I've been running on my very active household network since roughly 2013), I've been able to get a good feel for what lists cause issues and which don't. This experience lets me categorise the lists and, more importantly, provide easily accessible recommendations for you to implement into your network.

There's also the fact that there are very few sources of original blocklist content out there. A considerable percentage of lists I've seen is essentially the ["I made this" meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-made-this), which leads to the following issues:
  * Cessation: Consolidated lists deprive the original list maintainer of visits.
      * If their visit count falls, it's reasonable to expect one would stop updating the list because their efforts are no longer appreciated
      * Lack of maintenance can lead to even less original blocklist content
  * Centralisation: You're letting one entity essentially dictate what can and can't be blocked
      * This puts a *lot* of workload on a single person to maintain changes to their consolidated list, potentially bringing into question how long a consolidated list will be maintained for, which could become an issue due to the "set and forget" nature of DNS sink-holing
      * The consolidated list maintainer may not always be up-to-date with the original list source
      * Additions and removals may not be passed upstream to the maintainer of that original list, benefitting more people overall   

My goals are to:
  * Credit other maintainer's high-quality content by way of "direct hits"
  * Make their content as easy to access for others as possible
  * Not require payment or to nag for donations
  * Have a transparent changelog thanks to GitHub's commit history

These goals ensure every interested individual or group can have better control over their Internet experience.

On a related note, I have zero interest in maintaining content inside various blocklists, except for the handful of domains I put into [my blocklist](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt) which have cropped up here and there over the years because it was quicker to add to that list than submit to anyone else.

## Found a false positive, but don't know which list contains it?
Run `pihole -q blockeddomain.com`, and it will return the URL of the block list.

## Know which list contains the false positive?
Click on the big blue "Toggle List Maintainer Sources" button to show the source of a particular blocklist. Via the source page, you should be able to find the contact details for the list maintainer.

Some lists are sourced from an "adblock" style list which are flat-out NOT designed to work with DNS sinkholes, and there WILL be mistakes with how these are parsed due to how domain names are extracted and exceptions handled. Before reaching out to one of the fine folks at EasyList, **PLEASE** confirm your issue still exists when using an Adblock plugin such as uBlock/ABP/etc. If the issue isn't present when using an Adblock plugin, raise an issue **here** first.

For every other list, get in touch with them to remove the false positive - if you're not able to find the maintainer's contact details, please feel free to reach out to me.

## Lists which I host at `v.firebog.net`:
These lists are automatically updated, and are a domains-only (Pi-hole friendly) format of what the original list maintainer provides. I **do not** make any additions or subtractions to these lists (except for my personal blocklist).

My automated parser/mirror has the following methods in place to minimise risk of being auto IP banned:
  * It should not retrieve a remote file if it has already done so within 24 hours
  * It will get the HTTP status, ETag and Last-Modified headers of a remote file using cURL
  * cURL uses a custom user-agent which specifically identifies `v.firebog.net`
  * If the HTTP status is 403, the script should not attempt retrieval until after 5 weeks (2.964e+6 seconds)
  * It will compare server ETag header with the previously stored ETag, and only retrieve the file contents if necessary
  * In the event a server is not configured with the ETag header, the Last-Modified header will be used in place
  * If the Last-Modified header does not exist, it will retrieve a new copy, make a comparison with the existing version and update if necessary
  * A cron job will fire off my script every **two** days (Sun/Tue/Thur/Sat at midnight AEST) (Or twice a week for `Prigent-Adult.txt` due to size)

## On the subject of "non-domain entries":
As mentioned before, I do not make additions or subtractions to content â€” therefore it isn't my place to correct the issues from upstream lists. **Please do not create an issue for non-domain entries** that come up when running `pihole -g` as they are already being filtered out.

## Unable to find the list maintainer; they're unresponsive or have another issue?
Open a ticket here, and I'll be happy to see what I can do.

I attempt to reply to GitHub tickets and mentions <i>as soon as I notice them</i>, so by all means __please__ `@` ping me <a href="https://firebog.net/about">anywhere that I frequent</a> that's convenient for you if `@`'ing on GitHub doesn't get a reply in a day or two. Also, if a ticket is closed, you are welcome to comment on it still if you have any question, comment or concern. :smiley:
